        <h2>Theory of Operation</h2>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Unit Type.Incubator">Each incubator chamber in an <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Voltage.220V">SMI12-2</MadCap:conditionalText> <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Voltage.110V">SMI12</MadCap:conditionalText> is independently powered and heated.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h3>Heating</h3>
        <p>When powered, the <MadCap:variable name="Shellab_Variables.Unit Type" /> heats to and then maintains a user-selected target set point in the <MadCap:variable name="Shellab_Variables.Unit Type" />  chamber. The <MadCap:variable name="Shellab_Variables.Unit Type" /> senses the chamber air temperature using a solid-state probe mounted on the chamber interior wall. When the <MadCap:variable name="Shellab_Variables.Unit Type" /> detects that the chamber temperature has dropped below the target set point, it pulses power to the heating elements inside the chamber walls<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Unit Type.Incubator"> and in the outer chamber door</MadCap:conditionalText>.</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Snippets/Operation/Theory_of_Ops_Heating.flsnp" />
        <p MadCap:conditions="Unit Type.Incubator">Each chamber door is self-heating to bolster the thermal uniformity and stability of the chamber and to minimize condensation on the glass viewing door. The inner glass door will cool while the chamber door is opened, eventually leading to condensate on the door and impacting the chamber temperature stability and uniformity. Minimize sample viewing times when possible.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3>The Over Temperature Limit System (OTL)<a name="OTL_System"></a></h3>
        <p>The OTL is a mechanical heating cutoff included with each <MadCap:variable name="Shellab_Variables.Unit Type" /> and operates independently of the unit microprocessor temperature controller. The OTL helps safeguard the unit by preventing runaway heating in the event of hardware failures or a sudden external heat spike. The OTL is connected to a hydrostatic sensor probe located inside the <MadCap:variable name="Shellab_Variables.Unit Type" /> and is intended to be set by the user to approximately <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Unit Type.Incubator">1°C</MadCap:conditionalText> <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Unit Type.Oven,Unit Type.Vacuum Oven">10°C</MadCap:conditionalText> above the target temperature set point.</p>
        <p>If the chamber temperature exceeds the OTL cutoff setting, the OTL routes power away from the chamber heating elements. It will continue to do so as long as the chamber air temperature is higher than the OTL cutoff setting. A red indicator illuminates when the OTL is rerouting power.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3 MadCap:conditions="Unit Type.Incubator">Data Logging and Outputs</h3>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Unit Type.Incubator">The incubator logs up to 5 years of temperature data, with measurements recorded every 60 seconds. The log can be exported an as a spreadsheet-readable .CSV file using the USB port on the right side of the incubator. A 4 — 20 milliamp data port outputs temperature data as an analog signal suitable for building monitoring systems. An open / closed dry contact port communicates alarm activation instances.</p>
