        <h3>Muting the Audible Alert</h3>
        <p>Tapping the mute icon mutes the currently active alarm.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The audible alert remains silent until the alarm deactivates or until another alarm activates.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The mute icon disappears when the alarm deactivates.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3>Deactivating an Alarm</h3>
        <p>Alarms deactivate when the unit returns to normal operating conditions.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Door Alarm:</b> Deactivates when the door is closed.</li>
            <li><b>Deviation Alarms</b>: Deactivate when the incubation chamber temperature returns to within the temperature deviation alarm bounds set by the user.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>

        <h2>Power and Memory</h2>
        <p>The incubator stores all set points and other settings in non-volatile RAM. The unit will retain its settings indefinitely in the event of a power outage.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h2>Data Log</h2>
        <p>The incubator logs the current chamber temperature and the temperature set point once per minute.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Alarm activations are logged at the moment the alarm is activated.</li>
            <li>Power outages are retroactively logged as starting at the moment of outage.</li>
            <li>The incubator stores up to 5 years of continually logged data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Logged data can be viewed as a graph on the incubator by touching the graph icon.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>

        <h2>Real Time Data Outputs</h2>
        <p><b>TEMP:</b>  4 – 20mA analog output describing the current chamber temperature.</p>
        <p>The output uses a jack port on the right side of the incubator. The port connects to an audio jack (male mono phono plug, ¼ inch (6.3 mm).</p>
        <p>Jacks and cables are <b>not</b> included with the incubator.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3>Data Monitoring Systems – Max Resistance</h3>
        <p>For building management and other data monitoring or logging systems, the maximum resistance of the current loop from the 4-20mA module is 250 Ohms. At higher loop resistances, the current value will be erroneously low for parameter values near the top of the scale.</p>
        <p><b>Alarm:</b> Dry Contact Port</p>
        <p>This port communicates all alarm activations as On / Off outputs in which Open position indicates an alarm instance. The port connects to an audio jack and cable (male mono phono plug, ¼ inch (6.3 mm).</p>
        <p>Jacks and cables are <b>not</b> included with the incubator.</p>
        <p>The USB port does not output data in real time.</p>
