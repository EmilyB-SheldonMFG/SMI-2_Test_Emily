        <h2>Power and Memory</h2>
        <p>The incubator stores all set points and other settings in non-volatile RAM. The unit will retain its settings indefinitely in the event of a power outage.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h2>Data Log</h2>
        <p>The incubator logs the current chamber temperature and the temperature set point once per minute.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Alarm activations are logged at the moment the alarm is activated.</li>
            <li>Power outages are retroactively logged as starting at the moment of outage.</li>
            <li>The incubator stores up to 5 years of continually logged data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Logged data can be viewed as a graph on the incubator by touching the graph icon.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;" class="right">
            <li>The default graph view shows a 24-hour block of time. This is the widest data view.</li>
            <li>Touching the graph on a vertical guideline centers the graph on that point in time.</li>
            <li>The graph can be zoomed in to show a 6- or 1-hour block of time.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The ( ? ) Help button brings up a color legend for the graph.</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li>Power Outage includes periods during which the unit is off.</li>
        </ul>
