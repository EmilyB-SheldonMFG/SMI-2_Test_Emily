        <h3>Over Temperature Limit (OTL)</h3>
        <p>This graduated dial sets the heating cut off point for the Over Temperature Limit (OTL) system. The OTL helps prevents unchecked heating of the chamber in the event of a hardware failure or external heat spike. For more details, please see the <a href="../../Topics/SL_Operation/Theory_of_Ops.htm#OTL_System">Over Temperature Limit System</a> description in the Theory of Operations (page <MadCap:xref href="../../Topics/SL_Operation/Theory_of_Ops.htm#OTL_System" class="ConceptPageNumber">1</MadCap:xref>).</p>
        <p>The red Over Temperature Activated light illuminates when the OTL system cuts off heating to the unit chamber by rerouting power away from the heating elements.</p>
