        <p>Temperature calibrations are performed to match an <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Unit Type.Incubator">incubator</MadCap:conditionalText> temperature display to the actual air temperature inside the<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Unit Type.Incubator"> incubation</MadCap:conditionalText> chamber. The actual air temperature is supplied by a calibrated reference device. Calibrations compensate for long-term drifts in the <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Unit Type.Incubator">incubator </MadCap:conditionalText>microprocessor controller as well as those caused by the natural material evolution of the sensor probe in the heated <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Unit Type.Incubator">incubator </MadCap:conditionalText>space. Calibrate as often as required by your laboratory or production protocol, or regulatory compliance schedule. Always calibrate to the standards and use the calibration setup required by your industry requirements or laboratory protocol.</p>
