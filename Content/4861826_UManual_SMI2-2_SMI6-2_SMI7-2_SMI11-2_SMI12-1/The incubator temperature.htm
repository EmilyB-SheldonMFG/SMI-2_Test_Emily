        <p>The incubator temperature controller employs proportional-integral-derivative analytical feedback-loop functions when measuring and controlling the chamber air temperature. PID-controlled heating pulse intensities and lengths are proportional to the difference between the measured chamber temperature and the target set point. The frequency of pulses is derived from the rate of change in the difference. The integral function slows the rate of pulses when the temperature nears the set point to avoid overshooting.</p>
