        <p>Long-term use of a large water container, such as a humidifier pan, will create excess water vapor in the unit and can damage the electrical components of an SMI incubator. Additionally, use of deionized water may cause significant corrosion damage to the incubator. Overloading the unit with sample media may also damage the incubator from excessive media evaporation and disruption of air flow pathways through the shelf space.</p>
