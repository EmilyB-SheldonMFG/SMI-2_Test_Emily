        <p>Temperature calibrations are performed to match an incubator temperature display to the actual air temperature inside the incubation chamber. The actual air temperature is supplied by a calibrated reference device. Calibrations compensate for long-term drifts in the incubator microprocessor controller as well as those caused by the natural material evolution of the sensor probe in the heated incubator space. Calibrate as often as required by your laboratory or production protocol, or regulatory compliance schedule. Always calibrate to the standards and use the calibration setup required by your industry requirements or laboratory protocol.</p>
