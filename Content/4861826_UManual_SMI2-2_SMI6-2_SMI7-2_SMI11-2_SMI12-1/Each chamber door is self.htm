        <p>Each chamber door is self-heating to bolster the thermal uniformity and stability of the chamber and to minimize condensation on the glass viewing door. The inner glass door will cool while the chamber door is opened, eventually leading to condensate on the door and impacting the chamber temperature stability and uniformity. Minimize sample viewing times when possible.</p>
