            <br />The OTL is a mechanical heating cutoff included with each incubator and operates independently of the incubator microprocessor temperature controller. The OTL helps safeguard the incubator by preventing runaway heating in the event of hardware failures or a sudden external heat spike. The OTL is connected to a hydrostatic sensor probe located inside the incubator and is intended to be set by the user to approximately 1°C above the target temperature set point.</p>
