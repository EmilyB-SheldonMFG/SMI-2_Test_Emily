        <p>Small Sample Load</p>
        <p>Placing a small number of petri dishes or other media containers in the incubator chamber may lead to excessively fast drying of sample media. A small water-filled container, such as an open flask, may be placed in the chamber to help slow sample drying with small loads.</p>
