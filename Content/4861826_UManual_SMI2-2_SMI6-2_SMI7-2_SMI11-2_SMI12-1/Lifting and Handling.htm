        <h1><a name="_Toc514075215"></a>Lifting and Handling</h1>
        <p>The unit is heavy. Use appropriate lifting devices that are sufficiently rated for these loads. Follow these guidelines when lifting the unit:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <p style="list-style-type: disc;">Lift the unit only from its bottom surface.</p>
            <p style="list-style-type: disc;">Doors, handles, and knobs are not adequate for lifting or stabilization.</p>
            <p style="list-style-type: disc;">Restrain the unit completely while lifting or transporting so it cannot tip.</p>
            <p style="list-style-type: disc;">Remove all moving parts, such as shelves and trays, and lock doors in the closed position during transfers to prevent shifting and damage.</p>
        </ul>
