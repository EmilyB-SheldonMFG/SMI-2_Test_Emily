        <p>As the level of humidity rises in an incubation chamber, condensate will first appear on surfaces that are cooler than the air temperature. Near the dew point, condensate forms on any item or exposed surface even slightly cooler than the air. When the dew point is reached, condensate forms on nearly all exposed surfaces.</p>
